,WFH before-during COVID,,Time series for the amount of working from home before COVID (as of 2019 in the American Time Use Survey) and since the start of the pandemic. See https://wfhresearch.com/tracking-wfh/ for more on our latest methodology.
,,,
,,date,Month of Survey wave - YYYYMM. For Pre-COVID use 3 months before first wave
,,wfhcovid_matquestion,"Current amount of WFH, % of full paid working days - equal-weighted average across workers. The value for March 2020 contains our UPDATED ESTIMATE (as of September 2023) of Pre-COVID WFH, as % of full paid working days using microdata from the 2019 American Time Use Survey"
,,wfhcovid_frac_HPS,"Current amount of WFH, % of full paid working days from the Census Household Pulse Survey (HHP) - our estimate based on HHP microdata. We assign a given wave (""week"") of the HHP to the calendar month that covers most days when that wave was in the field. Therefore, multiple waves of the HHP may be used to compute a single monthly estimate. You may find more information about the HHP at the link: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html"

,,,
,WFH 1965 - present,,"Time series with historical data on the share of full paid days that are working from home days, going back to 1965. We use data from the American Heritage Time Use Study (AHTUS) for 1965, 1975, 1985, 1993, 1995, and 1998, the American Time Use Survey for 2003 to 2019, and append that to our preferred WFH series using our own Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes from May 2020 to the most recent month. We also include a series estimating the share of workers who are fully remote from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 1980 to 2019. In the AHTUS, ATUS, and ACS we restrict attention to persons earning $20,000 or more per year (measured in 2019 dollars) to match the earnings threshold for the SWAA during May 2020 to March 2021. (Starting in April 2021, the SWAA expanded to include persons earning between $10,000 and $20,000 per year.) In the ATUS and AHTUS, we count paid workdays as ones in which the individual devotes six or more hours of work to their main job, regardless of work location, and we count work-from-home days as ones in which the individual works six or more hours on their main job at home. This approach corresponds to the SWAA-based measure. In the ACS, we count someone as being fully remote if they say they work from home when asked for their primary commute mode (accounting for most of their commute distance). For further details, see the README at: https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/historical_wfh_readme.txt."

,Workday-weighted WFH series,,"Time series for the amount of working from home since May 2020. The series in this tab computes an average across workers that weights each worker by the number of days they worked in survey's reference week. Prior to November 2020, we did not ask how many days people worked during the week. In those early months we use an equal-weighted average, so the series in this tab and the one in the tab titled ""WFH before-during COVID"" are identical prior to November 2020. See https://wfhresearch.com/tracking-wfh/ for more on our latest methodology."

All are 6 month centered moving averages subject to data availability. Because the underlying survey question changed in November 2020, we do a 3-month average for August to October 2020 (plotted as the October data point) and separately compute the 6-month centered moving average for November 2020 and later data. We do not have reliable data on geography prior to August 2020. We define cities using Combined Statistical Areas and obtain the list of major cities by population from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area (accessed in July 2022)."
