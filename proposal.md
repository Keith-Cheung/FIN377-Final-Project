By Keith Cheung, Danny Hubert, Josh Simon

## Big Research Question: What is the relationship between WFH and the quantity of startups being developed?

- Specifically focusing on the increase in WFH since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its theoretical direct impact on the amount of startups that have been developed
- Big Picture: What drives creation of startup? Why are they created? 
- Measure of our Success: the R2 between amount of WFH and Startup Development

## Hypothesis
We believe that there will be a strong correlation between the increase of WFH since 2019 and the amount of startups that have been created. We believe that with an increase in WFH flexibility, more people are starting their own businesses.
