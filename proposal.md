# Research Proposal: Did the increase in Work From Home during and following the COVID 19 pandemic have an impact on the quantity of Startups being developed?
By Keith Cheung, Danny Hubert, Josh Simon

## Big Research Question: What is the relationship between WFH and the quantity of startups being developed?

- Specifically focusing on the increase in WFH since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its theoretical direct impact on the amount of startups that have been developed
- Big Picture: What drives creation of startup? Why are they created? 
- Measure of our Success: the R2 between amount of WFH and Startup Development

## Hypothesis
We believe that there will be a strong correlation between the increase of WFH since 2019 and the amount of startups that have been created. With an increase in WFH flexibility, more people are starting their own businesses.

## Data
- Sample Period: 2019-2023
- Observation: WFH % vs. total number of startups developed
- Sample Conditions: Restricting ourselves to these years and to the amount of startups, not on the longevity or success in order to judge if the increase in flexibility from WFH inspires creation

    - * More internet searching, reaching out to Lehigh Libraries *
- Raw Inputs: Go into our links and take note of what is in there that we will be collecting
- High Level Transformation Hypothesis: Merge multiple datasets, create visualizations to display regression results + other statistics we find important for our report
